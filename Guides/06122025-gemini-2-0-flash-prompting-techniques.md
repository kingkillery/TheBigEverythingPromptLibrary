[full document text]

Task: Synthesize insights across all documents to identify:
1. Key market opportunities
2. Competitive threats and advantages
3. Strategic recommendations
4. Resource allocation priorities

Cross-reference findings between documents and highlight any contradictions or areas requiring clarification.
```

## Advanced Reasoning with Thinking Mode

### Enabling Thinking Mode

Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental automatically engages deeper reasoning for complex problems, but you can explicitly request it:

```
"Use step-by-step thinking to solve this complex problem. Show your reasoning process clearly as you work through each component."
```

### Optimal Thinking Mode Prompts

#### Mathematical Problem Solving
```
Problem: A company has three factories producing widgets at different rates and costs. Factory A produces 100 widgets/hour at $2/widget, Factory B produces 150 widgets/hour at $2.50/widget, and Factory C produces 200 widgets/hour at $3/widget. 

Given the following constraints:
- Total production needed: 10,000 widgets
- Maximum 16 hours production time
- Budget limit: $25,000
- Factory A can only operate 12 hours maximum
- Factory B has maintenance downtime from hour 8-10

Optimize the production schedule to minimize cost while meeting the deadline.

Please think through this step-by-step, showing your reasoning for each decision.
```

#### Scientific Analysis
```
Research Question: Analyze the potential effectiveness of a new cancer treatment based on these preliminary study results.

Study Data:
- Sample size: 200 patients
- Control group: 100 patients (standard treatment)
- Treatment group: 100 patients (new treatment)
- Primary endpoint: 6-month survival rate
- Control group result: 65% survival
- Treatment group result: 78% survival
- p-value: 0.032

Additional Factors:
- Treatment cost: 3x standard treatment
- Side effect profile: Similar to standard treatment
- Patient quality of life scores: 15% improvement in treatment group

Think through the statistical significance, clinical significance, cost-effectiveness, and ethical considerations step by step. Provide a comprehensive assessment of the treatment's potential.
```

#### Complex Logical Reasoning
```
Logic Puzzle: Five friends (Alice, Bob, Carol, David, and Emma) are seated around a circular table. Use the following clues to determine the seating arrangement:

1. Alice is not sitting next to Bob
2. Carol is sitting two seats away from David
3. Emma is sitting directly opposite to the person wearing a red shirt
4. Bob is wearing a blue shirt and is sitting next to the person in red
5. David is not wearing red
6. The person in the green shirt is sitting between Alice and Carol
7. There are exactly two people between Emma and Alice

Work through this systematically, using logical deduction to eliminate possibilities and arrive at the solution.
```

### Thinking Mode Best Practices

1. **Request Explicit Reasoning**: Ask to see the thinking process
2. **Encourage Self-Validation**: Request verification of intermediate steps
3. **Break Down Complex Problems**: Allow the model to decompose naturally
4. **Expect Higher Accuracy**: Leverage reduced hallucination rates

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Response Quality Issues

**Issue**: Generic or superficial responses
```
Problem Diagnosis:
- Insufficient context provided
- Vague requirements
- Missing specific constraints or objectives

Solution:
Add detailed context, specific requirements, and clear success criteria:

❌ Poor: "Write about climate change"
✅ Good: "Write a 1000-word analysis of climate change impacts on agriculture in Southeast Asia, focusing on rice production challenges, adaptation strategies, and economic implications for smallholder farmers. Include specific data from recent studies and policy recommendations."
```

**Issue**: Inconsistent reasoning in Thinking Mode
```
Problem Diagnosis:
- Problem too complex for single prompt
- Insufficient validation requests
- Missing constraint specification

Solution:
Break down complex problems and request validation:

"Solve this step-by-step, validating each intermediate result before proceeding to the next step. If you identify any inconsistencies in your reasoning, please backtrack and reconsider your approach."
```

### Tool Integration Problems

**Issue**: Tool not being used when expected
```
Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Explicitly request tool usage
2. Specify why the tool is needed
3. Provide context for tool selection

Example Fix:
"I need current information about this topic. Please use web search to find the latest developments in quantum computing from 2024, then analyze the findings."
```

**Issue**: Outdated information despite tool availability
```
Solution:
Explicitly remind about knowledge cutoff and request current data:

"Given that my knowledge cutoff is August 2024, please search for the most recent developments in this area to ensure accuracy and currency of information."
```

### Performance Optimization Issues

**Issue**: Slow response times
```
Optimization Strategies:
1. Use more specific prompts to reduce processing scope
2. Request concise output format when appropriate
3. Break large tasks into smaller components

Example:
❌ Slow: "Analyze everything about this company"
✅ Fast: "Analyze this company's Q3 financial performance focusing specifically on revenue growth and profit margins"
```

**Issue**: Verbose responses when brevity needed
```
Control Strategy:
Explicitly request concise format:

"Provide a brief, bullet-point summary focusing only on the top 3 most important insights. Maximum 150 words total."
```
