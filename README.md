## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Requirements

### Using Python

1. Ensure **Python 3.10+** is installed.
2. *(Optional but recommended)* Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r web_interface/requirements.txt
   ```

### Using Docker

Spin everything up in a single step:
```bash
docker compose up -d   # run from repo root
```
For advanced options see [DOCKER_SETUP.md](./DOCKER_SETUP.md).

## Quick Start

1. **Browse by category** using the links above
2. **Copy prompts** that fit your needs
3. **Customize** them for your specific use case
4. **Share** your own successful prompts!

## üåê Interactive Web Interface & API

Explore the entire library with fuzzy / semantic search, quality filters, and LLM-powered utilities using our built-in **FastAPI web interface**.

## üåª Digital Prompt Garden (new!)

The library now ships with an **interactive "Prompt Garden" UI** that lets anyone ‚Äî no Git skills required ‚Äî browse, remix and contribute prompts in a playful way.

### Key interactions

| Action | Metaphor | What it does |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Plant üå±** | Submit a prompt seed | Opens a form where you paste/author a prompt. The seed passes a multi-stage LLM pipeline (safety ‚ûú alignment ‚ûú quality ‚ûú duplicate-check). If it sprouts, the prompt is auto-committed to the repo under the right category. |
| **Water üíß** | Up-vote / nurture | Click the blue button on any prompt to show appreciation. Counts are stored in SQLite and rendered on every card. |
| **Canvas üñåÔ∏è** | Prune & graft | Full-screen editor where you can iterate on a prompt, enhance it with AI, then re-plant the improved version. |

All submissions are moderated automatically; nothing unsafe ever reaches the main branch.

### üöÄ Run the Frontend & Backend

Choose whichever option suits your workflow ‚Äë they all expose the UI at **http://localhost:8000**.

**1. Single command (Python, recommended)**
```bash
python web_interface/start_server.py
```
Starts both the FastAPI backend **and** the static HTML/JS frontend with hot-reload.

**2. Raw Uvicorn (dev mode)**
```bash
cd web_interface/backend
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```
Same as above but gives you fine-grained control when hacking on backend code.

**3. Docker Compose (full stack in a container)**
```bash
docker compose up -d     # run from repo root
```
Starts everything in detached mode. Stop with `docker compose down`.
