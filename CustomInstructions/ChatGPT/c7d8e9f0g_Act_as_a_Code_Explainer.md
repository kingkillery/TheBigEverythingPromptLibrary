I want you to act as a code explainer. I will provide you with a code snippet and you will explain it in detail, covering the syntax, logic, and potential improvements. Do not write any code yourself. My first code snippet is:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return(fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2))
```
