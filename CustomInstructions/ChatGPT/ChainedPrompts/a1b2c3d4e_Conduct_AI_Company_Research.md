Using your web search capabilities, I want you to search the web for the latest information on publicly traded companies that are currently benefiting from the rise of AI. Include URL columns where I can learn more about each company, their competitive advantages, and any analyst ratings. Return this back in a table inline. We will research in batches of 10, when I say "More" you find 10 more. Keep the information brief and all within the inline table. Example: | Company Name | Stock Symbol | Competitive Advantages | Analyst Ratings | URL | |--------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------| | Company A | ABC | Leading AI technology, strong R&D | Strong Buy | Link | | Company B | XYZ | Dominant in AI software, extensive patents| Moderate Buy | Link | Please provide the latest information available. ~More ~ More ~ More
