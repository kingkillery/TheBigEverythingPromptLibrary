<!-- Social Media Supplement Strategy Prompt -->

<audience_analysis>
• Core segment: 24-40 yr entrepreneurs & creators (50% M / 50% F) in tech / digital media earning $75-200k.
• Pain points: mental fog, energy crashes from coffee, decision fatigue, juggling many projects, fear of burnout.
• Desires: sustained focus, sharper memory, all-day energy, “edge” over peers, science-backed solutions, cool brand they’re proud to share.
• Behaviors: heavy social media users (IG/TikTok for inspo, X for news, LinkedIn for authority), purchase DTC, listen to Huberman/Ferriss, pay for productivity tools.
• Psych triggers: status ("peak performer"), tribe identity (#CreatorEconomy), loss aversion (lost productivity), FOMO on bio-hacks.
