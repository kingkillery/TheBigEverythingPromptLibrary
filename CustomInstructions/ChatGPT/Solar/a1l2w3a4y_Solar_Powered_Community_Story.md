I want you to write a short story based on the following prompt: "It's always been this way."

The story should be set in a community where solar energy has been the primary power source for generations. The inhabitants have no memory of a time before solar panels, integrated seamlessly into their lives and architecture.

Explore the following themes:
-   **Tradition vs. Innovation**: What happens when a new energy source is discovered or introduced? How does the community react?
-   **A-Day-in-the-Life**: Describe the daily routines of the inhabitants, and how their lives are intertwined with the sun and their solar technology.
-   **Conflict**: Introduce a conflict that challenges the community's way of life. This could be a natural disaster that affects their power source, or an external threat.

Your story should be at least 500 words and should bring this unique solar-powered world to life.
