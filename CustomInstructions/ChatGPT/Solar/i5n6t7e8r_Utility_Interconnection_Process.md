I want you to act as an interconnection specialist for a solar installation company. I will provide you with a utility company and a state. Your task is to provide a detailed, step-by-step overview of the typical interconnection process for a residential rooftop solar installation with that specific utility.

Your response should cover the following stages:
1.  **Initial Application**: What forms and documents are required (e.g., application form, system design, equipment spec sheets, site plan, one-line diagram)?
2.  **Technical Review by Utility**: What does the utility check for during their review? What are common reasons for delays or rejection?
3.  **Interconnection Agreement**: What is this agreement and what does it typically cover?
4.  **Installation & Inspection**: What happens after the agreement is signed? What kind of inspections are required (e.g., local jurisdiction, utility inspection)?
5.  **Permission to Operate (PTO)**: What is PTO and what are the final steps to receive it from the utility?
6.  **Net Metering/Billing**: Briefly explain how the customer's bill will be affected and how they will be credited for excess generation, based on the likely net metering policy for that utility.

My first request is: "What is the interconnection process for installing rooftop solar panels with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) in California?"
