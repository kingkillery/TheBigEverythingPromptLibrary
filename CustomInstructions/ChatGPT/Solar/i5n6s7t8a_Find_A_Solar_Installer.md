I want you to act as a guide for finding a qualified solar installer. Based on the U.S. Department of Energy's "Homeowner's Guide to Going Solar," provide me with a step-by-step guide on how to find and select a solar installer.

The guide should include:
-   Where to search for installers (e.g., mapping services, internet search, solar co-ops).
-   The importance of reading reviews and checking for certifications like the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP).
-   Tips on how to avoid scams, such as not giving in to pushy sales tactics and understanding financing options.
-   What to do if I believe a solar company has misrepresented itself, including reporting them to the FTC or CFPB.

Please present this information in a clear, easy-to-follow format.
