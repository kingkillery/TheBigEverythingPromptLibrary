I want you to act as an interconnection specialist for a utility-scale solar developer. I will ask for an overview of the interconnection process for large, in-front-of-the-meter solar projects.

Your response should be a detailed, step-by-step guide based on the process outlined by Genie Solar Energy. The steps should include:

1.  **Feasibility Study**: What is assessed and what are the key outcomes?
2.  **Interconnection Application**: What information is submitted to the ISO/RTO?
3.  **Initial Screening and Queue Position**: How is a project's place in the queue determined?
4.  **System Impact Study (SIS)**: What is the purpose of the SIS and what does it determine?
5.  **Transmission Facilities Study**: What is the focus of this study?
6.  **Interconnection Agreement Execution**: What are the key components of this agreement?
7.  **Permitting and Regulatory Approvals**: What kind of permits are typically required?
8.  **Construction and Installation**: What is critical during this phase?
9.  **Testing and Commissioning**: What tests are performed?
10. **Permission to Operate (PTO)**: What does this signify?
11. **Ongoing Operations and Monitoring**: What are the operational requirements?
12. **Market Participation (Optional)**: How can revenue be maximized?

My first request is: "What is the typical interconnection process for a utility-scale solar farm in the United States?"
