## Complete PickleBoxer Tips & Best Practices

### **The 4 Fundamental Principles**

1. **Split Your Prompts**
   - Break prompts across multiple steps for single outcomes
   - Better results than combined prompts
   - Example: Review first, then refactor based on review

2. **Give Examples**
   - Provide expected inputs, data, and outputs
   - Improves accuracy and quality significantly

3. **Be Specific**
   - List exactly what you want, know, need
   - Specify what NOT to include
   - Don't be afraid of detailed instructions

4. **Ask for Reflection**
   - Use "reflexion" technique to increase accuracy
   - Ask "Why were you wrong?"
   - Get AI to review its own responses

### **Multi-Prompt Workflow (The PickleBoxer Method)**

```
Step 1: Modernize and Add Best Practices
"Review the following code and re-write it to modern es6 programming standards and formatting:"

Step 2: Review for Logical Errors and Security
"Review your provided code 'tempFunction' for any logical or security concerns and provide a list of recommendations."

Step 3: Validate Recommendations (Reflexion)
"Review your above recommendations. Tell me why you were wrong and if any recommendations were overlooked or incorrectly added?"

Step 4: Write the Final Code
"Re-write the 'tempFunction' function based off your review and recommendations."

Step 5: Create Tests
"Create two [define technology] tests for the above 'tempFunction' function. One that is expected to pass and one that is expected to fail."
```

### **Why This Workflow Works**

- **Separated Concerns**: Each prompt has a single responsibility
- **Error Catching**: Multiple review stages catch issues
- **Reflexion**: Self-validation reduces hallucinations
- **Testing**: Ensures code actually works
- **Systematic**: Consistent, repeatable process
