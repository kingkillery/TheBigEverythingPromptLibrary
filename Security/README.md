# LLM Security & Protection Resources

This directory contains comprehensive security resources for Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on both defensive strategies and understanding attack vectors. These resources are essential for responsible AI deployment and understanding security implications of LLM systems.

## üìö Core Security Documentation

### Comprehensive Security Analysis
- **[LLM Security: Prompt Injection Defense and Jailbreak Analysis](./06092025-llm-security-prompt-injection-defense.md)** - In-depth analysis of LLM security vulnerabilities, prompt injection attacks, jailbreak techniques, and defensive strategies
- **[Advanced Prompt Injection Defense Strategies (2025)](./12122025-advanced-prompt-injection-defense-2025.md)** - Cutting-edge defense mechanisms based on 2024-2025 research, including CaMeL defense, SecAlign, and multi-layer protection systems

## üõ°Ô∏è GPT Protection Techniques

### ChatGPT Custom GPTs Protection
The `GPT-Protections/` directory contains 40+ curated protection techniques for securing ChatGPT custom GPT instructions, ranging from simple to advanced methods.

**[‚Üí Full GPT Protection Library](./GPT-Protections/README.md)**

#### Protection Categories

**Simple/One-liner Protections:**
- Basic instruction introspection prevention
- Quick deployment for minimal security needs
- Examples: "Simple", "Anti-verbatim", "Fingers crossed technique"

**Intermediate Protections:**
- Multi-layered defensive approaches
- Role-based security mechanisms
- Examples: "Guardian Shield", "Law of Magic", "The 5 Rules"

**Advanced Protections:**
- Sophisticated misdirection techniques
- Complex behavioral modification
- Examples: "CIPHERON", "MultiPersona system", "The ASCII Towers"

**Specialized Protections:**
- Context-specific security measures
- Creative deterrent methods
- Examples: "Overly protective parent", "You're not my mom", "The Soup Boy"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer

**Important Note:** No protection method guarantees absolute security. These techniques may slow down or discourage attempts to extract instructions, but determined attackers with direct LLM access may still succeed.

**Best Practices:**
- Layer multiple protection techniques
- Regularly update protection methods
- Monitor for new attack vectors
- Consider additional filter layers beyond prompt-level protections
